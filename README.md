# Ray Tracing in One Weekend (in Rust)

I followed the awesome Tutorial [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley) but used Rust.

## Render an image

I use [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) to clean up and render a new image. Just type

```
cargo make all
```
